# Creating Projects in this Organization

A project should be "community-native" to Community Projects and should have at least two collaborators. It's okay to incubate an idea in a personal GitHub and move it to this organization after finding one or more collaborators. The main collaborators of a project must be AWS Community Builders.

To have a project created in the organization, it must have at least two collaborators who are AWS Community Builders. The collaborators should attend a Community Projects meeting and pitch the idea after which one of the organization owners can create appropriate repositories and grant rights to them.

Projects should offer a unique take on solving a problem or can demonstrate the use of a specific combination of technologies, provided it goes beyond "hello world".

# Organization Owners

Organization Owners will be individuals who are active within both AWS Community Builders and specifically the Community Projects initiative. Organization Owners can choose to resign at any time and must maintain standing as AWS Community Builders.

New Organization Owners can be proposed by existing Organization Owners and require a simple majority of existing Organization Owners to confirm. Organization Owners will address any Code of Conduct violations.

# Project Owners

Each Project in the Organization should have at least two Project Owners. Project Owners are AWS Community Builders who are the primary collaborators and contributors to that project. Project Owners can invite other AWS Community Builders to join them in being Project Owners on their Projects at any time. Project Owners can resign at any time or be removed for Code of Conduct violations.

Project Owner may be synonymous with Repository Owner. The distinction merely allows for Projects that span more than one code repository.

Project Owners should be clearly stated in any code repositories for their Projects.

# Outside Contributors

Accepting pull requests from contributors outside the Project Owners or outside AWS Community Builders will be at the sole discretion of the Project Owners for a project. Contribution Guidelines should be posted in every code repository.

# Stale Projects

A yet-undefined process may be implemented in the future for pruning stale projects and ensuring all the content here is current.
