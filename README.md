# AWS Community Builders Community Projects

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

These are projects built by and for the community. Community Projects are a place for collaboration, a way for us to come together and move the needle on cloud tooling, adoption, and understanding.

## What This is Not

This is not a place to boost personal projects or sell a product or service. We will of course use and demonstrate vendor offerings, but never as a sales pitch.
